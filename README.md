# Machine Learning Property Valuation

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between the selling prices of properties and the socioeconomic and infrastructure characteristics of different neighborhoods in Buenos Aires. The goal is to determine if sellers are pricing properties fairly based on location and surrounding conditions, and to identify the most influential factors in property pricing.

The project was developed as a practice exercise inspired by a course in Python for Data Science, but it can be expanded to use real data from governmental sources in larger-scale applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python: for all data manipulation and model building.
- Google Colab: development environment.
- Pandas: data manipulation and cleaning.
- NumPy: to handle numerical operations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: data visualization and plotting.
- Scikit-learn: to implement the Linear Regression model.
- Google Drive: store and access datasets.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data

- Neighborhood Data: Extracted from the Government of Buenos Aires' website, providing socioeconomic and infrastructure information.
- Property Listings: Simulated data for the properties, with location codes created specifically for this project. The data could easily be replaced with real location codes in future iterations.

The dataset includes:

* Neighborhood codes
* Property characteristics (size, type, etc)
* Socioeconomic factors (security, schools, infrastructure, etc)

## üéØ Project Objectives

Analyze whether property sellers are pricing properties fairly, given the neighborhood and surrounding conditions and determine which factors (e.g., security, infrastructure, etc.) have the greatest impact on the price of properties.
This project aims to help potential buyers and sellers better understand the influence of neighborhood factors on property prices.

## üîç Model & Methodology

The project employs a Linear Regression model to predict property prices based on neighborhood characteristics.

Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Using Pandas, I cleaned and transformed the dataset for analysis.
- Model Training: Implemented a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.
- Feature Selection: Analyzed the importance of neighborhood features to see which had the most significant impact on pricing.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model performance using common metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (Explanation of these metrics below).

## üìà Model Performance


## üîß Potential Improvements

- Replace simulated data with real property listings and neighborhood codes from Buenos Aires.
- Use more advanced models (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) to improve prediction accuracy.
- Incorporate more features, such as historical price trends and inflation data.

## üìö Conclusion

This project not only demonstrates the process of data cleaning, visualization, and predictive modeling using Python and Machine Learning, but also serves as a practical tool for understanding the relationship between property pricing and neighborhood characteristics. Future iterations could make this tool valuable for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents alike.
